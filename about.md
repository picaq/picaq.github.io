# About this blog

---

Hello, this is Mandy’s blog. I am a software engineer, graphic designer, illustrator and musician.

This Jekyll blog was started to:
1. make my [README](/) prettier
2. post my [vegan recipes](/food/recipes)
3. migrate [my gists](https://gist.github.com/picaq){:target="_blank"} to a structured, searchable place
4. more to come!

## Why Jekyll?

There are many CMS options such as WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and cooler features if I used React, Laraval or Ruby and Rails. 
Why Jekyll?

- Static sites are blazing fast
- Easy fast and free to deploy
- A bunch of documentation and prior discussion
- Ruby is a joy to use
