# About this blog

---

Hello, this is [Mandy’s blog](https://picaq.github.io/about). I am a software engineer, graphic designer, illustrator and musician.

This Jekyll blog was started to:
1. make my [README](/#picaqgithubio) prettier
2. post my [vegan recipes](/blog/food/recipes)
3. migrate [my gists](https://gist.github.com/picaq) to a structured, searchable place
4. more to come!

## Why Jekyll?

There are many CMS options such as WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and cooler features if I used React, Laraval or Ruby and Rails. 
Why Jekyll?

- Static sites are blazing fast
- Easy fast and free to deploy
- A bunch of documentation and prior discussion
- Ruby is a joy to use

Current build and deployment times are about 1 minute each for a [2 minute pipeline](https://github.com/picaq/picaq.github.io/actions).
