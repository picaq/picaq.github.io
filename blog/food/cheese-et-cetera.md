# Cheese et Cetera

I used to have a really bad cheese addiction. I like yogurt too. 

Trying not to clog my arteries over here!

Here are some tasty alternatives. Coconut oil is the absolute bane of my existence. I&nbsp;will&nbsp;compare&nbsp;the saturated fat content by grams/serving as well as by % weight of the tastiest fermented non-dairy dairy alternatives that I’ve tried so far. Not included are those that I didn’t like.

## Cheese

## Conclusion
More yogurt less “cheese” (fermented nuts).

## Lactose Intolerant?
I’m actually not lactose intolerant at all, hence quitting dairy cheese was _so_ difficult for me.
This&nbsp;table&nbsp;format&nbsp;could be useful for anyone dairy-free due to either lactose intolerance or&nbsp;dairy&nbsp;allergies.
