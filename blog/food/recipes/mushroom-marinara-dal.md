intro: I usually meal prep this in a mason jar or two and eat it over the course of 1 – 3 weeks.
description: Spicy, hearty and filling main or side dish that tastes like home.
ingredients_blurb: Everything after water is optional and added to taste.
ingredients:
  - 1 cup red lentils
  - 1 jar of marinara sauce
  - 2 – 3 cups of kombu dashi or water
  - 1 cup sliced mushrooms
  - tomato paste
  - ghost pepper hot sauce
  - vegan ponzu
  - tamari
  - pepper powder
instructions:
  - Optional&#58; start pre-boiling the cooking water or kombu.
  - Rinse and strain the lentils until the water runs clear. It usually takes me 4 – 7 rinses.
  - Boil the lentils in 3 cups of water ( 2 if adding mushrooms ) for 10 – 20 minutes depending on desired tenderness.
  - Stir in the marinara sauce and adjust to taste with the rest of the ingredients.
  - Optional&#58; re-boil the dal mixture for the flavors to meld together even more.
result_blurb: >-
  I would use the original marinara sauce jar as well as the mason jar used to rinse and cook the lentils to store leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.
