## Mushroom [Ghost Pepper] Marinara Dal

I usually meal prep this in a mason jar or two and eat it over the course of a 1 – 3 weeks.

### Ingredients

Everything after water is optional and added to taste.

- 1 cup red lentils
- 1 jar of marinara sauce
- kombu dashi or water
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- tomato paste
- ghost pepper hot sauce 
- vegan ponzu
- tamari
- pepper powder

### Instructions

1. Rinse and strain the lentils until the water runs clear. It usually takes me 4 – 7 rinses.
2. Boil the lentils in 3 cups of water (2 if adding mushrooms) for 10 – 20 minutes depending on desired tenderness.
3. Stir in the marinara sauce and adjust to taste with the rest of the ingredients.
4. Optional: re-boil the dal mixture for the flavors to meld together even more.
   
I would use the original marinara sauce jar as well as the mason jar used to rinse and cook the lentils to store leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.

### Serving Options

I usually eat this with:

- a slice or two of steamed sourdough bread (because I don’t know how to make idli and this is close enough for me)
- steamed organic green peas
- pita chips
- naan
