# Dairy Free Milks

I recently bought a soy milk maker, which is basically a stainless steel blender with a heating element. It&nbsp;has [6 pre-programmed sequences](#pre-programmed-functions). 
Here&nbsp;are the included recipes in the manual in case I can’t find it.

## Basic Formula

The milk making process follow the same basic formula and instuctions. The only things you need are the ( a ) main ingredient(s): food, and water ( e ). Sweeterners and flavorings ( b – d ) are optional. 

### Ingredients

1. nuts, soy or fruit
2. sweetener
3. spices or flavorings
4. dash of salt
5. water ( just under 1 liter )

### Instructions

1. Add ingredients ( a – d ) into the milk maker. 
2. Add water ( e ) above the min but below the max water line.
3. Press function button ( 10 – 35 minutes ).
4. Unplug the power cord before pouring out the liquid.
5. Optionally: strain the milk in a strainer or nut bag.

2. sugar
3. 2 tsp vanilla extract
  <br> 6 – 7 pitted medjool dates  
2. dash of salt
3. oat milk ( just under 1 liter )

### Bean Milk

**Beans** : 35 minutes
{: .label .label-yellow }

For creamier soy milk, it is best to rinse and then warm soak the beans for a few hours (2 – 4), and then rinse again before blending or portion out the soaked, rinsed beans into jars in the fridge overnight to blend the next day. For storing the beans overnight, I also add a teaspoon of salt. If you rinse overnight-soaked salted soy beans, the soy milk will end up pretty tasteless and watery so it is preferred to pour the salted soak water into the machine along with the beans.

Before serving, the soy milk foam, if any, should be skimmed off the surface. Overnight-soaked salted soy beans will cook and blend without forming a foam on top.

### Pre-programmed functions

Default temperature settings are in **bold** and may or may not be selectable as shown:

|            | Time (hh:mm) |  Temp (°C) 0F |   1F   |   2F   |         |
|-----------:|-------------:|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|
|       Nuts |          :15 |   room temp   |   45   | **60** |    -    |

## Custom Usage

### Nuts function at 0F 
- cuts down the blending time to :08
- I use this, and/or the Juice function to make fruit smoothies
- I add in raw rolled oats ( 2 – 3 tbsp ) and/or cooked edamama ( 1/4 – 1/3 cup with its cooking water ) for extra fibre and protein

### Grains function
I use this to make hot chocolate. It results in very smooth, fluffy and airy hot cocoa.

#### Hot Chocolate 
  
1. 4 squares of dark chocolate
2. 3 – 4 tsp maple syrup and/or dark brown sugar
3. 2 tsp vanilla extract and/or
  <br>2 tbsp cacao powder 
5. dash of salt
6. any of the above milks ( about 500 – 700 cc )
7. optional, but recommended: 1 – 2 tbsp soy creamer

## Experiments

- I threw in a piece of guava into a fruit smoothie, skin and seeds included and left the smoothie for some time and it ended up fizzy and boozy
- I made a fruit smoothie that is exclusively frozen berries plus edamame and it slightly coagulated after left to sit
