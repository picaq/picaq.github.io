   The ingredients are exteremely basic but for safety, there is an *absolutely necessary* long wait for the cooking vessel to cool down.

   - tamari
   - slivered onions ( optional )
   - miso paste ( optional )
instructions:
   - Add carrots and tamari ( to taste ) to a large ceramic bowl. If desired, add onions. Add a splash of water if the ingredients seem dry.
   - Cover the top of a bowl with a wider, overturned ceramic bowl or plate. 
   - Microwave the carrot bowls for&#58; <ol>
      <li>3 minutes on the highest power, </li>
      <li>followed by 2 minutes at 30% power </li>
      <li>and finally, 22 minutes on the lowest power setting.</li></ol>

   The carrots should look bruised and wrinkly in appearance, sometimes with dark spots, but taste sweet, caramelized and savory. The texture is extremely soft and melts in your mouth. It can be refrigerated for a week or two.

### Why not use an instant pot or pressure cooker?

I don’t have one, and I don’t want to clean a specialized large, separate cooking vessel. If you were able to successfully replicate this recipe using those appliances let me know!
