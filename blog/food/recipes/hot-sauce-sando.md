## Hot Sauce Sando (or Toast)

<!-- image -->

### Ingredients

- Sriracha (or your favorite hot sauce)
- peanut butter
- tamari (optional)
- sliced bread of choice
- basil (highly recomended but optional)
- baby spinach (optional)

### Instructions

1. Toast slice(s) of bread (optional but recommended).
2. Make the spread: mix peanut butter and Sriracha together, adjust ratios to taste and tolerance. <br>
   Optional: add tamari for saltiness or to thin out the spread.
3. Spread the mixture on the inside-facing sides of the bread slice(s).
4. Optional: top with 1-2 basil leaves and/or baby spinach.

### Serving Options

- Using a single slice of toasted bread would make this a Hot Sauce Toast.
- You can turn this into a sandwich by clamping 2+ toasts together.
- I also like spreading a bit garlic achaar or harissa sauce on top for extra flavor depth.
- With the breads subbed for rice paper, veggies doubled and spread halved, the contents could be made into a Vietnamese spring roll.
