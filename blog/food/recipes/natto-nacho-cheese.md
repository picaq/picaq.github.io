The resulting texture and color should resemble nacho cheese.

### How does it compare to regular nacho cheese?

- creamy and slightly sticky just like real nacho cheese
- you can customize the level of umami
- doesn’t dry out quickly like nacho cheese, where the cheese requires heating to stay melted and the roux dries out and hardens as water evaporates
- high protein, low-carb and somewhat low fat
- far less oily: the primary source of oil is from the cashew butter
- less filler ( flour/roux/starch, sodium citrate ) means more flavor
- can be eaten at room temperature, warmed or chilled

### More Cheese!
This recipe can easily be adapted to make [cheesy peas](cheesy-peas) instead.
