# Sheet Music

I make music and play music. 

## Made

Ok I mostly transcribe music into formats for specific instruments.

Here’s an app, [Notation Map](/notation-map/), that I’m making to help me pick up new instruments. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;unfinished.


### Violin

The very first piece I transcribed in 2008 or 2009 while I was still in high school, and the first Orisinal entry on ichigos.com, [Winter Bells](https://ichigos.com/sheets/323).
[Youtube cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGISv0aDvEg) re-arranged by Sherry Kim for Viola.


### Kalimba tabs?

I get asked this sometimes but I prefer transcribing music into staff notation due to being instrument-agnostic and its ease to adapt to other instruments.
In the near future I will sort sheet music by chromatic range rather than by instrument.
