# Spells

I’m currently playing Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition with [Tiger Kong](https://tigerkong.me/). 

<!-- Here is his guide: [D&D Collection](https://tigerkong.me/dnd/)  -->

### Vicious Mockery

| ----------------- | ------------- |
| School            | Enchantment   |
| Classes           | Bard          |
| Ritual?           | No            |

| Components        | V             |
| Cast Time         | 1 Action      |
| Range             | 60 feet       |

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range.

If the target can hear you (thought it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

#### At Higher Levels

This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

### Mending

| Range             | Touch                                            |

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloack, or a leaking wineskin.

As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

#### At Higher Levels

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice).

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

### Healing Word 1d4

| Basic Information |                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

#### At Higher Levels

### Speak with Animals

| Basic Information |                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| School            | Divination          |

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration.

The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM’s discretion.

### Comprehend Languages

| Basic Information |                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| School            | Divination                         |
| Classes           | Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard    |
| Ritual?           | Yes                                |
| Duration          | 1 hour                             |
| Components        | V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt) |
| Cast Time         | 1 Action                           |
| Range             | Self                               |

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear.

You also understand any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface of which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.

### \*Dancing Light

| Basic Information |                                                          |

| Ritual?           | No                                                       |
| Duration          | Concentration, up to 1 minute                            |
| Components        | V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm) |
| Cast Time         | 1 Action                                                 |

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration.

You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.

### \*Polymorph

| Basic Information |                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| School            | Transmutation                  |
| Classes           | Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard  |
| Ritual?           | No                             |
| Duration          | Concentration, up to 1 hour    |
| Components        | V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon) |
| Cast Time         | 1 Action                       |
| Range             | 60 feet                        |

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. This spell can’t affect a target that has 0 hit points.
