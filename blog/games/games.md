# Games

I make games and play games.

## Made

### A Doll Dress-Up Game
This is [a dress up game](https://mandychen.art/ccsf/cnit133/game/). Click or tap on the clothes to put them on. <br>Illustrations by the Italian illustrator Jessica Cioffi aka [@Loputyn](https://www.instagram.com/loputyn).

### Boogle Board
Is it Boogle Board or Boggle Board? A [classic word search game](https://picaq.github.io/JS-HTML-Games/) made with vanilla JavaScript.

### React! The Organic Chemistry Game
The first, if not only, educational and chemically accurate [organic synthesis board game](https://www.reactgame.com/). Made&nbsp;with&nbsp;sweat&nbsp;and&nbsp;tears. Layout and illustrations by me!

## Playing

- Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition with [Tiger Kong](https://tigerkong.me/).
