## Object

A JavaScript Object that stores key-value pairs. For frequent insertion/deletion and updating, a&nbsp;[Map&nbsp;object](./map) is preferred.

### Merge Key & Value Arrays

merge arrays of keys and values with matching indexes into an object

```js
Object.fromEntries(arrKeys.map((item,i) => [item,arrVals[i]]));
```
