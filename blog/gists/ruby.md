# Ruby

Ruby is great, though the only chance I get to use it as of late is writing [plugins for this blog](https://github.com/picaq/picaq.github.io/tree/master/_plugins).

The [ruby-practice](https://github.com/picaq/ruby-practice/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#ruby-practice-and-notes) repository contains my most-visted ruby notes.

[ruby-koans](https://github.com/picaq/ruby-koans?tab=readme-ov-file#ruby-koans) is my progress learning ruby by testing edge cases.
