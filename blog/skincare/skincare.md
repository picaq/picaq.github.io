# Skincare

Skin is the largest organ and the first barrier of defense. 
I am a longtime sufferer of sunburn, acne, eczema, dry skin and keratosis pillaris, all of which have been resolved or managed. 

Topics to be included: 

- Light:
  - UV defense tactics
  - sunscreen, parasols, UPF clothing, window filters
  - red/blue light therapy
- Vitamins! (mostly C, E & polyphenols)
  - foods such as fruits, protein and tremella
  - topical vitamins and antioxidants
- Moisture
  - moisturizers
    - humectants
    - occlusives
  - skin sprays
  - favorite product ingredient breakdown
- Oil
  - hair/skin/nail oiling
  - oil blotting papers
